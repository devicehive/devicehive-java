DeviceHive Java server
======================

[DeviceHive]: http://devicehive.com "DeviceHive framework"
[DataArt]: http://dataart.com "DataArt"

DeviceHive turns any connected device into the part of Internet of Things.
It provides the communication layer, control software and multi-platform
libraries to bootstrap development of smart energy, home automation, remote
sensing, telemetry, remote control and monitoring software and much more.

Connect embedded Linux using Python or C++ libraries and JSON protocol or
connect AVR, Microchip devices using lightweight C libraries and BINARY protocol.
Develop client applications using HTML5/JavaScript, iOS and Android libraries.
For solutions involving gateways, there is also gateway middleware that allows
to interface with devices connected to it. Leave communications to DeviceHive
and focus on actual product and innovation.

DeviceHive Java installation instructions
=========================================

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to use DeviceHive framework you must have the following components installed and configured:
* [PostgreSQL 9.1](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) or above.
* [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html#others) suitable for your version of PostgreSQL
* [Glassfish 4.1](http://glassfish.java.net/download.html) application server (Java EE 7 Full Platform)
* [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [OpenJDK 7](http://openjdk.java.net/)
(this is requirement for Glassfish 4.1; Java EE 7 requires JDK 7). JDK 8 will be fine too.
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to compile and package db_dhtool and DeviceHiveJava
* [dh_dbtool source files](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java). dh_dbtool.jar will be used to provide necessary database migrations
* [DeviceHiveJava source files](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java). This is the main part of the [DeviceHive[ framework


Build packages
--------------
* Download source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java) using "Download ZIP" button.
It should always point to recent stable or beta release, but you always can get any other tag or branch.
It also can be done using one of [Git version control client](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) or git command line tool.
If you prefer git, clone project using command

`git clone https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java.git`

After that you can switch to the tag or branch you need. The list of all available releases can be found at
https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java/releases
* Execute the following command from ${devicehive-java-directory}/tools/dh_dbtools:

`mvn clean package`

* Execute the same command from ${devicehive-java-directory}/server.

If this steps are done correctly you will find DeviceHiveJava.war at ${devicehive-java-directory}/server/target and dh_dbtool.jar
at ${devicehive-java-directory}/tools/dh_dbtools/target.
After successful compilation and packaging go to the next step.


Database setup
--------------
* After you have downloaded and installed PostgreSQL (see https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
you have to create new user. This step is required for database migrations to work properly.
* Create database using user that have been created at step 1. This user should be owner of database.
* Run dh_dbtool.jar to update your database schema and insert some initial parameters.
Go to dh_dbtool.jar installation directory and run this application using command

`java –jar dh_dbtool.jar -migrate -url ${databaseurl} -user ${login} [-password ${password}]`

* The parameter ${databaseurl} is a jdbc connection URL to your database (like jdbc://), ${user} is a database user’s login
and ${password} is a user’s password, if required. To get help use

`java –jar dh_dbtool.jar –help`


Glassfish configuration
-----------------------
* Install Glassfish 4.1 as it described in the [glassfish installation instructions](https://glassfish.java.net/docs/4.0/installation-guide.pdf).
* Deploy PostgreSQL jdbc driver to glassfish. Just put postgresql-jdbc4.jar (or another postgresql jdbc driver suitable
for your postgresql version) to ${glassfish installation directory}/glassfish/domains/${domain_dir}/lib/ext directory and restart glassfish.
* Then, run server and open ${yourServerName}:4848
* Navigate to Resources -> JDBC -> JDBC Connection Pools.
You have to create new JDBC Connection Pool to get access to your database. Configure general settings with following parameters:

Pool Name: Specify some pool name, e.g. DeviceHivePool  
Resource Type: javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource  
Datasource Classname: org.postgresql.ds.PGConnectionPoolDataSource

Specify pool settings at your convenience.

Specify transaction settings as follows:

Transaction Isolation: read-committed
Isolation Level: Guaranteed

Set additional properties:

In the user filed enter your database user login  
In the DatabaseName enter your database name  
In the Password field enter password for access to your database  
In the ServerName field enter your database server name

* Open Resources -> JDBC -> JDBC Resources. Create a new JDBC resource with properties:

JNDI name: jdbc/DeviceHiveDataSource  
Pool name: DeviceHivePool (use recently created pool name)

* Execute server -> General -> restart

Setup managed executor services:

* Open Resources -> Concurrent Resources -> Managed Executor Services. Create concurrent resources with properties:
1. JNDI Name: concurrent/DeviceHiveWaitService  
2. JNDI Name: concurrent/DeviceHiveMessageService

Deploying application
---------------------
When server is installed and all the required properties are configured, you have to deploy the application. 

* Go to ${yourServerName}:4848
* Open Applications tab.
* Click on Deploy button
* Click on “Select file” button. In the dialog box select DeviceHiveJava.war. Click on “Ok” button
* Launch DeviceHiveJava
* Set up web socket server URL and rest server URL. To do that you have to use link:

`http://${yourServerName}:${port}/DeviceHiveJava/rest/configuration/${name}/set?value=${value}`

The parameter “name” can be either “websocket.url” or “rest.url”  
The parameter “value” is associated URL for web socket and rest services.  
DeviceHive system specifies default login and password. These values can be used to get access for required services.

login: ***REMOVED***  
password: ***REMOVED***

Example:
* For rest server URL:

`http://localhost:8080/DeviceHiveJava/rest/configuration/rest.url/set?value=http://localhost:8080/devicehive/rest`

* For web socket server URL:

`http://localhost:8080/DeviceHiveJava/rest/configuration/websocket.url/set?value=ws://localhost:8080/devicehive/websocket`

* Use it.

DeviceHive Java update instructions
===================================

* Download [source code](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java) using "Download ZIP" button. It should
always point to the BRANCH-1.3. It also can be done using one of [Git version control client](http://git-scm
.com/downloads/guis) or git command line tool. If you prefer git, clone project using command

`git clone https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java.git`

After that you can switch to the tag or branch you need. The list of all available releases can be found at https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java/releases
* Run dh_dbtool.jar to update your database schema and insert some initial parameters.
Go to dh_dbtool.jar installation directory and run this application using command

`java –jar dh_dbtool.jar -migrate -url ${databaseurl} -user ${login} [-password ${password}]`

* The parameter ${databaseurl} is a jdbc connection URL to your database
(like jdbc://), ${user} is a database user’s login and ${password} is a user’s password, if required. To get help use

`java –jar dh_dbtool.jar –help`

* Go to ${yourServerName}:4848
* Open Applications tab.
* Click on Undeploy button (is not required)
* Restart glassfish server (is not required)
* Click on Deploy button
* Click on “Select file” button. In the dialog box select DeviceHiveJava.war. Click on “Ok” button
* Launch DeviceHiveJava

**Glassfish 4.1 is requiered!**

Notice, that the all parameters set up for configuration of RESTful and websocket services will be the same. If it is
 required to change these parameters use:

`http://${yourServerName}:${port}/DeviceHiveJava/rest/configuration/${name}/set?value=${value}`

You can get access to this service using any of your administrative accounts.  
For more details see [RELEASE_NOTES](https://github.com/devicehive/devicehive-java/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES)
