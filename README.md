DeviceHive Java Client Library & Examples
=========================================

[DeviceHive]: http://devicehive.com "DeviceHive framework"
[DataArt]: http://dataart.com "DataArt"
DeviceHive Client Library is an open source project based on Java. It can be used to build `Android` or `Java` applications.

DeviceHive turns any connected device into the part of Internet of Things.
It provides the communication layer, control software and multi-platform
libraries to bootstrap development of smart energy, home automation, remote
sensing, telemetry, remote control and monitoring software and much more.

## Creating client
Creating a client with a new version of library is very simple. First of all you need to initiate `DeviceHive` client:
```java
    DeviceHive deviceHive = DeviceHive.getInstance()
        .init("http://devicehive.server.rest.url", "refreshToken", "accessToken");
```
or you can initiate the client without Access token. In this case `DeviceHive` will automaticaly get it:
```java
    DeviceHive deviceHive = DeviceHive.getInstance()
        .init("http://devicehive.server.rest.url", "refreshToken");
```

<details>
 <summary><b>DeviceHive class methods</b></summary>

</details>

## Creating device
To create device you just need an instance of `DeviceHive` and `getDevice(String deviceId)` that returns `DHResponse<Device>` object where will be `FailureData` object in case of any errors or Device object:
```java
    DHResponse<Device> devicehiveResponse = deviceHive.getDevice("example-device-Id");
    if(devicehiveResponse.isSuccessful(){
	Device device = devicehiveResponse.getData();
    }else{
	FailureData failureData = devicehiveResponse.getFailureData();
	int code = failureData.getCode();
	String message = failureData.getMessage();
    }
```

<details>
 <summary><b>Device class properties and methods</b></summary>
    
`Device` contains such properties and methods:

Properties:
* `id` (read only)
* `name`
* `data`
* `network_id`
* `is_blocked`

Methods:
* `save()` - updates Device
* `getCommands(DateTime startTimestamp, DateTime endTimestamp, int maxNumber) ` - gets Device's DeviceCommands
* `getNotifications(DateTime startTimestamp, DateTime endTimestamp)` -  gets Device's DeviceNotifications
* `sendCommand(String command, List<Parameter> parameters) ` - sends DeviceCommand
* `sendNotification(String notification, List<Parameter> parameters) ` - sends DeviceNotification
* `subscribeCommands(CommandFilter commandFilter, DeviceCommandsCallback commandCallback)` - subscribes for DeviceCommands
* `subscribeNotifications(NotificationFilter notificationFilter, DeviceNotificationsCallback notificationCallback)` - subscribes for DeviceNotifications
* `unsubscribeCommands(CommandFilter commandFilter)` - unsubscribes from DeviceCommands that are not meeting filter criteria
* `unsubscribeAllCommands()` - subscribes from all DeviceCommands
* `unsubscribeNotifications(NotificationFilter notificationFilter)` - subscribes for DeviceNotifications that are not meeting filter criteria
* `unsubscribeAllNotifications()` - subscribes from all DeviceNotifications

 </details>

### Working with Device Commands
To create command you just need to call 
`sendCommand(String command, List<Parameter> parameters)` method that will return `DHResponse<DeviceCommand>` with `DeviceCommand` in case of success or `FailureData` with error message and HTTP response code in case of failure:
```java
    DHResponse<DeviceCommand> response = device.sendCommand("command name", parameters);
```
To subscribe on commands you just need to create `CommandFilter` where you can set all needed parameters and call `subscribeCommands(CommandFilter commandFilter, final DeviceCommandsCallback commandCallback)` method:
```java
    CommandFilter commandFilter = new CommandFilter();
        commandFilter.setCommandNames(COM_A, COM_B);
        commandFilter.setStartTimestamp(DateTime.now());
        commandFilter.setMaxNumber(30);
    
    device.subscribeCommands(commandFilter, new DeviceCommandsCallback() {
            public void onSuccess(List<DeviceCommand> commands) {
                }
            }
            public void onFail(FailureData failureData) {
            }
        });
```

<details>
 <summary><b>DeviceCommand class properties and methods</b></summary>
 
`DeviceCommand` contains such properties:
* `id` (read only)
* `user_id` (read only)
* `command` (read only)
* `parameters` (read only)
* `lifetime` (read only)
* `timestamp` (read only)
* `last_updated` (read only)
* `status`
* `result`

`DeviceCommand` contains such methods:
* `updateCommand` - updates current command
* `fetchCommandStatus` - gets command status
* `fetchCommandResult` - gets command result

</details>

### Working with Device Notifications
There us the same logic regarding `DeviceNotification` to create `notification` you just need to call 
`sendNotification(String notification, List<Parameter> parameters)` method that will return ` DHResponse<DeviceNotification>` with `DeviceNotification` in case of success or `FailureData` with error message and HTTP response code in case of failure:
 ```java
    DHResponse<DeviceNotification> response = device.sendNotification("notification name", parameters);
```
To subscribe on notifications you just need to create `NotificationFilter` where you can set all needed parameters and call `subscribeNotifications(NotificationFilter notificationFilter, DeviceNotificationsCallback notificationCallback)` method:
```java
    NotificationFilter notificationFilter = new NotificationFilter();
        notificationFilter.setNotificationNames(NOTIFICATION_A, NOTIFICATION_B);
        notificationFilter.setStartTimestamp(DateTime.now());
        notificationFilter.setEndTimestamp(DateTime.now().plusSeconds(10));
        
    device.subscribeNotifications(notificationFilter, new DeviceNotificationsCallback(){
            public void onSuccess(List<DeviceNotification> notifications) {
                    }
            public void onFail(FailureData failureData) {
            }
        });
```

<details>
 <summary><b>DeviceNotification class properties</b></summary>
 
`DeviceNotification` contains such properties:
* `device_id` (read only)
* `id` (read only)
* `notification` (read only)
* `parameters` (read only)
* `timestamp` (read only)

 </details>
 
 
 ### Working with Network
 To create `Network` you just need to call  `createNetwork(String name, String description)`  method of  `DeviceHive` class
 
 ```java
 DHResponse<Network> response = deviceHive.createNetwork("My Network's name", "My network's description");
 ```
 also you can get  `Network`  by id  `deviceHive.getNetwork(long id)` or get list of  `Network`  with `deviceHive. listNetworks(NetworkFilter filter)`
 
 ```java
 DHResponse<NetworkVO> response = deviceHive.getNetwork(response.getData().getId());
 ```
 <details>
 <summary><b>Network class properties and methods</b></summary>
 
 Properties:
 * `id` (read only)
 * `name`
 * `description`
 
 Methods:
 * `save()`  - updates `Network`
 
 </details>
 
 ### Working with User
 To create `User` you just need to call  `createUser(String login, String password, User.RoleEnum role, StatusEnum status, JsonStringWrapper data)`  method of  `DeviceHive` class
 
 ```java
 DHResponse<User> response = deviceHive.createUser("javaLibTest", "123456", RoleEnum.ADMIN, StatusEnum.ACTIVE, null);
 ```
 also you can get  `User`  by critria  `deviceHive.getUsers(UserFilter filter)` or just get current  `User`  `deviceHive.getCurrentUser()`
 
 ```java
 DHResponse<User> response = deviceHive.getCurrentUser();
 ```
 <details>
 <summary><b>User class properties and methods</b></summary>
 
 Properties:
 * `id` (read only)
 * `login`
 * `role`
 * `password` (write only)
 * `data`
 
 Methods:
 * `save()`  - updates `User`
 * `getNetworks()` - gets list of Networks assigned to this user
 * `assignNetwork(long networkId)` - assigns Network to this user
 * `unassignNetwork(long networkId)` - unassigns Network to this user
