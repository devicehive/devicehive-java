NOTES
=====

If it is required to switch from version 1.2 to version 1.3 it can be tricky according to
the glassfish 4 bug GLASSFISH-20704 (https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-20704). This bug appears when *.war file
is being deployed to the same context root as a previous *.war file. The following message appears:

Invalid ejb jar <war-name>]: it contains zero ejb. Note: 1. A valid ejb jar requires at least one session,
entity (1.x/2.x style), or message-driven bean. 2. EJB3+ entity beans (@Entity) are POJOs and please package them as
library jar. 3. If the jar file contains valid EJBs which are annotated with EJB component level annotations
(@Stateless, @Stateful, @MessageDriven, @Singleton), please check server.log to se...

There is 2 solutions for this problem:

1'st solution
-------------
* Deploy application to the another context-root, that is not in use. That can be done using undeploy/deploy options.

2'nd solution
-------------
* Install new version of devicehive java server as it described in installation guide using the same configuration
for the database.
* Set up the required context root for your application
* Undeploy previous version of devicehive server.
* Restart both versions of glassfish application server (if previous version of server is still in use)

Do not forget to update database schema. It can be done using dh_dbtool.
